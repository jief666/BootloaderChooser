// object files it is also an offset but from the start of the "section" for
// which the relocation entry is for.  See comments in <mach-o/loader.h> about
// the r_address field in images for used with the dynamic linker.
//
// In 4.3BSD a.out objects if r_extern is zero then r_symbolnum is an ordinal
// for the segment the symbol being relocated is in.  These ordinals are the
// symbol types N_TEXT, N_DATA, N_BSS or N_ABS.  In Mach-O object files these
// ordinals refer to the sections in the object file in the order their section
// structures appear in the headers of the object file they are in.  The first
// section has the ordinal 1, the second 2, and so on.  This means that the
// same ordinal in two different object files could refer to two different
// sections.  And further could have still different ordinals when combined
// by the link-editor.  The value MACH_RELOC_ABSOLUTE is used for relocation entries for
// absolute symbols which need no further relocation.
//

//
// For RISC machines some of the references are split across two instructions
// and the instruction does not contain the complete value of the reference.
// In these cases a second, or paired relocation entry, follows each of these
// relocation entries, using a PAIR r_type, which contains the other part of
// the reference not contained in the instruction.  This other part is stored
// in the pair's r_address field.  The exact number of bits of the other part
// of the reference store in the r_address field is dependent on the particular
// relocation type for the particular architecture.
//

///
/// mask to be applied to the r_address field of a relocation_info structure
/// to tell that is is really a scattered_relocation_info stucture
///
/// To make scattered loading by the link editor work correctly "local"
/// relocation entries can't be used when the item to be relocated is the value
/// of a symbol plus an offset (where the resulting expresion is outside the
/// block the link editor is moving, a blocks are divided at symbol addresses).
/// In this case. where the item is a symbol value plus offset, the link editor
/// needs to know more than just the section the symbol was defined.  What is
/// needed is the actual value of the symbol without the offset so it can do
/// the relocation correctly based on where the value of the symbol got
/// relocated to not the value of the expression (with the offset added to the
/// symbol value).  So for the NeXT 2.0 release no "local" relocation entries
/// are ever used when there is a non-zero offset added to a symbol.
/// The "external" and "local"  relocation entries remain unchanged.
///
/// The implemention is quite messy given the compatibility with the existing
/// relocation entry format.  The ASSUMPTION is that a section will never be
/// bigger than 2**24 - 1 (0x00ffffff or 16,777,215) bytes.  This assumption
/// allows the r_address (which is really an offset) to fit in 24 bits and high
/// bit of the r_address field in the relocation_info structure to indicate
/// it is really a scattered_relocation_info structure.  Since these are only
/// used in places where "local" relocation entries are used and not where
/// "external" relocation entries are used the r_extern field has been removed.
///
/// For scattered loading to work on a RISC machine where some of the
/// references  are split across two instructions the link editor needs to be
/// assured that each reference has a unique 32 bit reference (that more than
/// one reference is NOT sharing the same high 16 bits for example) so it move
/// each referenced item independent of each other.  Some compilers guarantees
/// this but the compilers don't so scattered loading can be done on those that

/// Relocations for x86_64 are a bit different than for other architectures in
/// Mach-O: Scattered relocations are not used.  Almost all relocations
/// produced by the compiler are external relocations.  An external relocation
/// has the r_extern bit set to 1 and the r_symbolnum field contains the symbol
/// table index of the target label.
///
/// When the assembler is generating relocations, if the target label is a
/// local label (begins with 'L'), then the previous non-local label in the
/// same section is used as the target of the external relocation.  An addend
/// is used with the distance from that non-local label to the target label.
/// Only when there is no previous non-local label in the section is an
/// internal relocation used.
///
/// The addend (i.e. the 4 in _foo+4) is encoded in the instruction (Mach-O
/// does not have RELA relocations).  For PC-relative relocations, the addend
/// is stored directly in the instruction.  This is different from other Mach-O
/// architectures, which encode the addend minus the current section offset.
///
/// The relocation types are:
///
///   X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED  // for absolute addresses
///   X86_64_RELOC_SIGNED    // for signed 32-bit displacement
///   X86_64_RELOC_BRANCH    // a CALL/JMP instruction with 32-bit displacement
///   X86_64_RELOC_GOT_LOAD  // a MOVQ load of a GOT entry
