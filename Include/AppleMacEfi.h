    Return the number of elements in an array.

    @param  Array  An object of array type. Array is only used as an argument to
                   the sizeof operator, therefore Array is never evaluated. The
                   caller is responsible for ensuring that Array's type is not
                   incomplete; that is, Array must have known constant size.

    @return The number of elements in Array. The result has type UINTN.
